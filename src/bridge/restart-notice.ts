/**
 * Restart breadcrumb + one-shot reminder.
 *
 * `pm2 restart` kills the whole node process — including every Claude session —
 * and respawns it. The agent that ran `metabot restart` therefore loses all
 * memory of having done so; when the next message arrives the session resumes
 * with "please restart" still in its history and the agent restarts again, in a
 * loop. To break it, `bin/metabot` writes a timestamp breadcrumb just before
 * `pm2 restart`; we read (and delete) it at boot, then inject a one-shot
 * `<system-reminder>` into the first turn of each chat telling the agent the
 * restart already happened and not to do it again.
