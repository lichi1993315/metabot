/**
 * Regression: PTY blank-card bug (prod 2026-05-30).
 *
 * The `metabot` bot had defaultWorkingDirectory: "." in bots.json. expandUserPath
 * returned "." unchanged (it only handled ~ and empty), so the PTY backend's
 * jsonl-path derivation — `cwd.replace(/\//g,'-')` — produced "." and the
 * scanner tailed `~/.claude/projects/./<id>.jsonl`, a path that never exists.
 * claude ran fine and wrote its jsonl to the REAL cwd's escaped dir, but the
 * scanner read nothing → the Feishu card completed with $0.00 and a BLANK body.
 *
 * Only `trunks` (the one bot with an absolute defaultWorkingDirectory) was
 * unaffected — which is why single-bot dogfooding looked healthy.
 *
 * The fix makes expandUserPath always return an ABSOLUTE path for non-empty
 * input. (pty-session also path.resolve()s defensively as a second layer.)
